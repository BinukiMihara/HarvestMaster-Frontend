              <h3>PREPARATION OF LAND</h3>
              <p>
                Land preparation refers to the procedure of arranging the
                cultivation area, in the best possible condition for Rice
                cultivation, ensuring the land is level and hydrated matching to
                the needs and requirements of the rice seeds planted.
                Preparation is done via machineries or by water buffaloes.

              <p>
                Selecting good seeds to harvest a healthy crop is very
                important. Thatâ€™s why cultivators go for pure seeds for their
                chosen rice variety, which are full and identical in size, free
                of weed seeds, and seed-borne diseases, insects and other
                matter.

              <p>
                Crop Establishment refers to managing a series of steps that
                includes, seeding, seed germination, seedling emergence and its
                development up until its stage of maturity, with other factors
                such as soil, climatic, biotic, machinery and management

              <p>
                Cultivated paddy has a higher sensitivity towards water
                shortages. They are in need of a steady supply of water, and it
                tends to immediately react by developing symptoms of water

              <h3>NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT</h3>
              <p>
                Plants, like all living organisms, require different nutrients
                at different stages of growth. By maintaining flooded conditions
                in a rice field, farmers can preserve soil organic matter and
                receive natural nitrogen, enhancing crop yield without the need
                for artificial nitrogen fertilizers

              <h3>CROP HEALTH MANAGEMENT</h3>
              <p>
                Crop health management is crucial, as healthy crops can attract
                pests and diseases. Before resorting to pesticides, it&apos;s
                best to prevent conditions that attract harmful organisms.
                Creating an anti-ecosystem for pests and diseases can naturally
                reduce their impact on crops.
